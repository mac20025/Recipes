# Overview

A simple Python project that connects to a SQL recipes database

I've created this software to demonstrate how to use Python to connect to a SQL database.

# Development Environment

For this software, I used:
- Visual Studio Code 1.91.1
- Python 3.10
- sqlite3 library

# The project has 3 files:
- initialize_db.py: Contains the code that will connect to the database
- db_operations.py: Stores the functions that handle database operations
- mains.py: Gets the program running
